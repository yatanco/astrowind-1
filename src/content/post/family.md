Shifting from being a lone ranger roaming through the world to becoming a stepdad and dad—while living with my partner, two teenage girls, a baby, and my 76-year-old mom—has been one of the biggest blessings of my life.  
But I would be lying if I said I didn’t find it daunting at the beginning.  

I’ve had a lot of experience facilitating workshops—lean, design thinking, sprints, team-building, culture building—you name it, I’ve probably done a few.

So it got me thinking: could I apply what I learned working with corporate and startup teams to my family?  
Isn’t a family just a team?

## Family Roles

In a family, we also have roles, job descriptions, fears, and anxieties.  
So what if I treated this as a team and started looking at the “jobs”?  

- **Kids**: Their job is to develop as people, gain skills, build self-esteem and curiosity, and prepare to create fulfilling adult lives.  
- **Grandma**: Her job is to enjoy her retired years, stay physically and mentally fit, share her wisdom and energy, and feel engaged and useful.  
- **Parents (my partner and me)**: Our job is to lead the team, listen to the other members, support each other, and nurture our relationship.

## Trying the “Stinky Fish” Exercise

When we moved in together, I brought this idea to the table and suggested we try a workshop format that Eva had once introduced to me: **Stinky Fish**.  
The exercise asks:  

> *“What fears and anxieties do you have about our future as a family?”*  

At the beginning of our journey together, the answers we heard included:  

- “I’m afraid of being left behind.”  
- “I’m afraid I will no longer have peace in my house.”  
- “I’m afraid I’ll lose my freedom.”  
- “I’m afraid of chaos in the house.”  
- “I’m afraid the dogs will make a mess.”  

…and many more. These were invaluable insights we could address and later revisit to check how everyone was feeling.

## Our First Steps as a Family

My partner and I made notes and decided on steps to prevent these fears from becoming reality. A few things we came up with:  

- Dedicated evenings with each of the girls every week (my partner).  
- Going out for lunch or ice cream with each of the girls (me).  
- Walking the dogs for 2 hours a day during the first month; they had to stay on the balcony when at home.  
- Encouraging the girls to invite their friends, so they’d feel it was *their* home.  
- Closing more doors so my mom could have quiet in the evening.  

I am grateful for having a background in facilitation, as I can structure interactions which really have no manual—like family life.  
And so our blended family journey began.

## Want to Try This with Your Family?

Here are some guiding questions you can explore together:  

- What “job” does everybody in the family have?  
- What fears or anxieties do they have about your shared future? (Write them down together – here’s the link: [Stinky Fish – SessionLab](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/stinky-fish))  
- How can you prevent these fears from coming true, or create a safe way to talk about them when they come up?
